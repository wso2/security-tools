<h1>Context Alert Filters</h1>
<p>
Context Alert Filters allow you to automatically override the risk levels
of any alerts raised by the active and passive scan rules within a context.
</p>
<p>
This add-on adds an 'Alert filters' panel to the contexts dialog.<br>
The panel shows a list of all of the Alert filters along with buttons for 
adding, removing and deleting them.
</p>
<p>
The 'add' and 'modify' dialogs have the following fields: 

<h3>Alert</h3>
A pull down containing all of the active and passive alert rules currently installed.

<h3>New Level</h3>
The new level to be assigned to any alerts raised that match the criteria defined by the rule.
 
<h3>URL</h3>
An optional URL.<br>
If specified then this rule will be applied if the URL matches the URL of a raised alert.<br>

<h3>URL is regex</h3>
If set and a URL is specified then the URL will be treated as a regex expression when compared with the URL of the alert.<br>
If it is not set then any specified URL must exactly match the URL of the alert.

<h3>Parameter</h3>
An optional parameter.<br>
If specified then this rule will be applied if the parameter exactly matches the parameter of a raised alert.<br>

<h3>Enabled</h3>
If set then this rule will be applied to all alerts raise against the given context.
